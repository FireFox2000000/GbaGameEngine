Requires a GBA devkit installation for compliation\
This project specifically uses devkitARM, which can be downloaded at https://devkitpro.org/

# Compilation notes 
For windows it is highly recommended to download MSys2 as the terminal used for compilation as Visual Studio's NMake does not work with the compilation rulesets. Setup can be found by following the links on the DevKitPro site.
